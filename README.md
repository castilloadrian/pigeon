pigeon is a fork of goose, built with a focus on providing a powerful user interface and companion for interacting with your favorite llms and mcp servers.

unlike goose, which emphasizes direct task execution, pigeon is designed to be your on-machine ai agent—making it easier to query models, automate complex development workflows, and manage projects end to end.

whether you’re prototyping ideas, refining code, or orchestrating sophisticated engineering pipelines, pigeon streamlines the process by offering a seamless interface to connect with your chosen tools. it supports any llm, enables multi-model configurations to balance performance and cost, and integrates natively with mcp servers.
